# Rick and Morty Explorer 🛸

A Flutter app for browsing characters from the Rick and Morty universe, built with a clean, layered architecture, the BLoC/Cubit pattern, and a fully responsive UI.

## ✨ Features

- 🧪 Browse all Rick and Morty characters in a responsive grid view (scales across devices via `flutter_screenutil`)
- 🔍 **Live search** — filter characters by name as you type, with a dedicated "no results found" state
- 🌐 **Real-time connectivity detection** — the app listens for network changes and shows a friendly "No internet connection" screen when offline
- 🎬 **Character details screen** with a `Hero` image transition from the grid into a `SliverAppBar`, plus status/species/gender info
- 🖼️ Smooth network image loading with custom animated loading indicators and graceful error handling (broken/missing images won't crash the UI)
- 💫 Custom loading animations throughout the app via `loading_animation_widget` (replacing the default spinner)
- 🏗️ Clean separation of concerns: **API layer → Repository → Cubit → UI**
- 🔄 Type-safe state management using `flutter_bloc` Cubit with Dart 3 sealed classes
- 🧭 Centralized named-route navigation via `AppRouter`, including passing arguments (selected `Character`) to the details screen

## 🚧 Roadmap

- ✨ Animated text effects for character names/details
- 📴 True offline support — persisting fetched characters locally (e.g. Hive/sqflite) so the app stays usable (not just informative) when there's no connection
- 🧪 Unit/widget tests for the Cubit and repository layers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** & **Dart**
- **flutter_bloc** (Cubit) for state management
- **Dio** for HTTP networking
- **flutter_screenutil** for responsive sizing across screen sizes
- **flutter_offline** for real-time connectivity detection
- **loading_animation_widget** for custom loading indicators
- [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) as the data source
